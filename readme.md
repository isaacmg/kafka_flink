# Flink and Kafka Streaming
This repository is meant as a practical use example of the [Facebook scraping system](https://github.com/isaacmg/fb_scraper) and streaming using Flink. To use this repository you should first download the fb_scraper and get it setup. Then you can use one of the realtime scraping functions to generate the inital Kafka message. This example should then receive the message and process them. Docker files, detailed instructions, and test cases will be forthcoming.
